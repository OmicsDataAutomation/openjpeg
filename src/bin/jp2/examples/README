Two executables are created with the building of the (ODA branch) OpenJPEG library and binary files.

cd_test - Compression and decompression codes that were used to build the compress_tile() and decompress_tile() functions 
within the TileDB JPEG2K codecs. The application will create int32 palette image in memory, compress the image to memory, 
write the compressed image to a file (for manual verification), decompress the image from memory, and write the
decompressed pixel values to a file (for verification).

While not part of the image, 3 integer "header" values are added as a prefix to the pixel data before sending the image to Compress. 
These bytes are read in compress to set parameter values of the number of components in the image, and the width and height of the 
image. These header bytes are stripped off the image before compression.

Before return from Decompress, the header bytes are restored as a preface to the returned pixel values.


cd_test_tile - Compression and decompression codes that were used to build the compress_tile() and decompress_tile() functions 
within the TileDB JPEG2K codecs. The application will create uint8_t palette image in memory, compress the image to memory, 
write the compressed image to a file (for manual verification), decompress the image from memory, and write the
decompressed pixel values to a file (for verification).
